JavaScript - Perl extension for executing embedded JavaScript

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JavaScript;

  my $rt = JavaScript::Runtime->new();
  my $cx = $rt->create_context();

  $cx->bind_function(write => sub { print @_; });

  $cx->eval(q/
    for (i = 99; i > 0; i--) {
        write(i + " bottle(s) of beer on the wall, " + i + " bottle(s) of beer\n");
        write("Take 1 down, pass it around, ");
        if (i > 1) {
            write((i - 1) + " bottle(s) of beer on the wall.");
        }
        else {
            write("No more bottles of beer on the wall!");
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Always thought JavaScript was for web-applications only? well, think again...

This modules gives you the power of embedded JavaScript in your Perl applications. You can
write your subroutines, classes and so forth in Perl and make them callable from JavaScript.
Variables such as primitive types, objects and functions are automagically converted between
the different environments. If you return a JavaScript function you can call it as a normal
code-reference from Perl.

JavaScript is a great as an embedded language because it has no I/O, no IPC and pretty much
anything else that can interfer with the system. It's also an easy yet powerfull language
that zillions of developers worldwide knows.

Note that this module is not a JavaScript compiler/interpreter written in Perl but an interface
to the SpiderMonkey engine used in the Mozilla-family of browsers.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item create_runtime ( ... )

Shortcut for C<JavaScript::Runtime->new(...)>.

=item get_engine_version

In scalar context it returns a string describing the engine such as C<JavaScript-C 1.5 2004-09-24>.

In list context it returns the separate parts of the string - engine, version and date of build.

=item does_support_utf8

=item does_handle_utf8

Returns a true value if SpiderMonkey is compiled with support for UTF8 strings and if we're using it.
B<does_handle_utf8> is also supported for backwards compability.

=item does_support_e4x

Returns a true value if we have compiled support for E4X.

=item does_support_threading

Returns a true value if we have compiled support for threading.

=item supports ( @features )

Checks if all features given in I<@features> are present. Is case insensitive. Supported keys are 
B<e4x>, B<utf8> and B<threading>. Extensions to this module may provide additional keys by implementing 
a method that begins with C<does_support_>.

=begin PRIVATE

=head1 PRIVATE INTERFACE

=over 4

=item js_get_engine_version

Returns a string with the output of C<JS_GetImplementationVersion()>.

=item js_does_support_utf8

Returns C<PL_sv_yes> if we have compiled SpiderMonkey with C<JS_C_STRINGS_ARE_UTF8>. Otherwise returns C<PL_sv_no>.

=item js_does_support_e4x

Returns C<PL_sv_yes> if we have compiled support for E4X. Otherwise returns C<PL_sv_no>.

=item js_does_support_threading

Returns C<PL_sv_yes> if we have compiled support for threading. Otherwise returns C<PL_sv_no>.
